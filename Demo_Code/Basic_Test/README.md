# BASIC_TEST.INO

This code basically checks that every element of the system is working.
**First,** check that the servo is rocking the beam freely
**Then,** check that the ball rolls freely on the beam relative to the angle of the beam
**Next,** check that the Ultrasonic Sensor is working and reporting accurate position of the ball relative to the ball's distance from the sensor
**Finally,** Use the serial monitor to check that the values from the sensor and actuator add up.
